	abstract = {Aims Evaluating the public health impact of regulatory interventions is important but there is currently no common methodological approach to guide this evaluation. This systematic review provides a descriptive overview of the analytical methods for impact research. Methods We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles with an empirical analysis evaluating the impact of European Union or non-European Union regulatory actions to safeguard public health published until March 2017. References from systematic reviews and articles from other known sources were added. Regulatory interventions, data sources, outcomes of interest, methodology and key findings were extracted. Results From 1246 screened articles, 229 were eligible for full-text review and 153 articles in English language were included in the descriptive analysis. Over a third of articles studied analgesics and antidepressants. Interventions most frequently evaluated are regulatory safety communications (28.8\%), black box warnings (23.5\%) and direct healthcare professional communications (10.5\%); 55\% of studies measured changes in drug utilization patterns, 27\% evaluated health outcomes, and 18\% targeted knowledge, behaviour or changes in clinical practice. Unintended consequences like switching therapies or spill-over effects were rarely evaluated. Two-thirds used before–after time series and 15.7\% before–after cross-sectional study designs. Various analytical approaches were applied including interrupted time series regression (31.4\%), simple descriptive analysis (28.8\%) and descriptive analysis with significance tests (23.5\%). Conclusion Whilst impact evaluation of pharmacovigilance and product-specific regulatory interventions is increasing, the marked heterogeneity in study conduct and reporting highlights the need for scientific guidance to ensure robust methodologies are applied and systematic dissemination of results occurs.},

	abstract = {Purpose The need for drug-related safety warnings is undisputed, and their impact should also be evaluated. This systematic review investigates and assesses the impact of safety warnings on drug therapy. Methods Studies published in English between January 1998 and December 2018 were searched in EMBASE and MEDLINE, complemented by manual search. Randomised controlled trials, cohort studies with a before/after component, and case-control studies were included, selected to predefined criteria, and assessed for their reporting and methodological quality. Results Out of 7454 references identified, 72 studies were included. A total of 28/72 (39\%) studies described the impact of safety warnings on drug therapy as being effective, whereas 12/72 (17\%) studies did not. Further, 26/72 (36\%) studies described a partial implementation of the warnings (one part of the warning had an impact on drug therapy and another did not). Unintended effects were investigated in 6/72 (8\%) studies. While 34 (47\%) studies examined safety warnings on psychotropic drugs using an interrupted time series (ITS) design (53\%), a before/after (26\%), and a time series design (21\%), 38 (53\%) studied other substances using an ITS design (34\%), a before/after (40\%), and a time series design (26\%). The proportion of an effective impact on drug therapy was lower in the “psychotropic drugs” group (23\%) than in the “others” group (53\%). Conclusion Drug-related safety warnings induce intended and unintended effects. The included studies are of broadly varying methodological quality. To better compare their effectiveness, studies should be conducted using standardised procedures.},

	abstract = {Communications about the safety and effectiveness of human drugs can influence patients’ and prescribers’ perceptions and behaviors, which in turn can affect the public’s health more broadly. We conducted a critical review of the literature on the unintended effects from communicating information to the public about safety issues with prescription and over-the-counter drugs. We searched PubMed for peer-reviewed studies published from 1990 to 2017 where study authors reported probable unintended effects of communicating drug safety. The types of communications included in these studies were news reports, direct-to-consumer advertisements, and those released by government agencies. Among the 26 studies identified, the most commonly reported unintended effects were decreased drug use or discontinuation. Other unintended effects included spillover to populations not targeted by the communications (e.g., discontinuation of antidepressants among adults following communications concerning use among youth), shifts in clinical diagnoses (e.g., fewer diagnoses of depression), increased use of alternative therapies, and other undesirable behaviors (e.g., possible increased suicide attempts because antidepressants were discontinued). Limitations to the literature include the inability to establish causation or to isolate the effects of multiple communication sources and messages. Further, because the intended effect of many communications was not known, our study was limited by challenges in defining some effects as unintended. Most studies used health insurer claims data to identify unintended effects of communications, which provide an incomplete picture; few used self-reported or other methodologies that could help illuminate the reasons underlying the effects observed in the claims data. Best practices for communicating about the potential benefits and harms of drugs in a manner that minimizes negative unintended effects are needed to protect and improve public health.},
